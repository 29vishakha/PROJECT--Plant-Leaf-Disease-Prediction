Plant Leaf Disease Prediction using Deep Learning 

This repository implements a system for predicting plant diseases based on leaf images. It leverages deep learning (or machine learning) techniques to effectively classify healthy leaves from those infected with various diseases.
Disease Classification: Accurately predicts common plant diseases from leaf images. (Specify diseases if focusing on a specific set)
Image Preprocessing: Includes image preprocessing techniques (e.g., resizing, normalization) to enhance model performance.
Model Training: Provides code for training a deep learning model (e.g., convolutional neural network) on a labeled dataset of plant leaf images. (Specify model if chosen)
Evaluation: Offers metrics to evaluate the model's performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)
